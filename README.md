# 🩺 Debugging Clinic - Frontend Bug Fix Showcase  
**By Drakulic Development**

A live collection of real frontend bugs and their solutions.  
Each case shows a broken version, the root cause, and a clean fixed version.  
This project demonstrates how I approach debugging, problem isolation, and UI/JS fixes for clients.

## 🌐 Live Demo  
(Will be added after GitHub Pages deployment)

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
The Debugging Clinic is a practical demonstration of my debugging workflow.  
Every example is based on the types of issues I regularly fix for clients:

- UI elements not responding  
- JavaScript not behaving correctly  
- Layouts breaking on mobile  
- Forms failing validation  
- CSS sizing and overflow issues  
- Event listeners not firing  
- Incorrect DOM targeting  
- Cross-browser inconsistencies  

If you need a bug fixed quickly, this is the kind of work I deliver.

# 🐞 Bug Case Studies

## **Bug #1 - Mobile Navigation Not Opening**
**Problem:**  
The mobile menu button does nothing when tapped.

**Cause:**  
The event listener was attached to the menu instead of the button.

**Fix:**  
Attach the listener to the correct button and toggle visibility properly.

**Demo:**  
- Broken version  
- Fixed version

## **Bug #2 - Form Validation Not Working**
**Problem:**  
The form submitted even when required fields were empty.

**Causes:**  
- Assignment operator used instead of comparison (`=` instead of `===`)  
- Missing `preventDefault()`  
- Validation logic not reached  

**Fix:**  
Add correct comparison, prevent default submission, and show clear messages.

**Demo:**  
- Broken version  
- Fixed version

## **Bug #3 - Layout Breaking on Mobile**
**Problem:**  
The layout overflowed horizontally on small screens and required side scrolling.

**Causes:**  
- Fixed container width  
- No wrapping behaviour  
- Cards too wide  

**Fix:**  
Use responsive flexbox rules, wrapping, breakpoints, and flexible sizing.

**Demo:**  
- Broken version  
- Fixed version

# 🛠 How I Debug  
My debugging workflow:

1. **Reproduce the bug** under the same conditions the user experiences.  
2. **Inspect HTML, CSS, and JS behaviour** using devtools.  
3. **Isolate the smallest possible cause** (selector, event, style, logic, DOM structure).  
4. **Apply a targeted fix**, not a patch that causes new problems.  
5. **Re-test thoroughly** across devices and screen sizes.  
6. **Explain the fix simply**, so the client understands exactly what changed.
